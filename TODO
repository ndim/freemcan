hostware: Allow setting measurement intervals on command line.

hostware: Allow giving commands on command line.

hostware: Ignore tty input after receiving an <esc>. Idea: Ignore
          stupid escape sequences.

hostware: For time series data, when receiving a value table, use
          the receive time and the total_duration to generate proper
          time stamps for the output file instead of just numbering
          the value table elements.

hostware: At least for time series value tables, link against libR.so
          and directly let R plot statistics.

firmware: Put EEPROM parameter block to a different place for each
          personality, so that changing the personality code does not
          require changing the parameters in EEPROM. Would only make
          sense if avrdude could program the flash without touching
          the EEPROM - which it cannot (or the ATmega cannot).

firmware: Device Signature

protocol: Migrate to CRC16 checksum using <util/crc16.h> on AVR,
          and TBD on the host.

hostware: Examine whether the checksum code can be made more simple
          by working with pure functions of the prototype

              uint16_t crc16_update(uint16_t crc, uint8_t byte)

firmware: Use <util/setbaud.h> for calculating baud rate?

firmware: Examine how doxygen copes with the new multiple parallel
          definitions of the same function/variable in different
          source files.
	  Answer: Badly. It just picks one.

firmware: Examine whether e.g. the adc-int and adc-ext histogram
          definitions (which differ only in table size) can be unified
          into a common source file.

firmware: Generate build-time configuration information summaries on
          the actual constants, clock frequencies etc. actually used
          in the build. Idea: Put numerical values into const data
          sections named something like ".configinfo.uart_baudrate",
          and then extract all ".configinfo.*" sections at build time
          to make them into config info reports (and avoid linking
          these sections into the actual firmware images).
