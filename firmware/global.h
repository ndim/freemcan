 * The ATmega devices can easily access IO registers below address
 * 0x1F with just 2 bytes of code for setting, clearing, or testing a
 * single bit. Also, those accesses all are atomic.
 *
 * So we try to store all our global flags in GPIOR0 which is an IO
 * register for just that purpose.

/** Global flag: Signal that measurement has finished
 *
 * Sends a signal from personality specific ISR code to the main event
 * loop that the measurement has finished.
 *
 * Set only in the ISR code, cleared only in the main event loop.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *  0. Startup default value is GF_CLEAR.
 *
 *  1. main event loop starts a measurement
 *
 *  2. personality specific code (ISR) code determines end of
 *     measurement and GF_SETs.
 *
 *  3. main event loop detects GF_ISSET, then handles the event, then
 *     GF_CLEARs.
