 *
 * There can be a number of kinds of variables.
 *
 *   a) Uninitialized non-register variables.  Those are placed in the
 *      .bss section in the ELF file, and in the SRAM on the device.
 *      The whole SRAM portion corresponding to the .bss section is
 *      initialized to zero bytes in the startup code, so we do not
 *      need to initialized those variables anywhere.
 *
 *   b) Initialized non-register variables.  Those are placed in the
 *      .data section in the ELF file, and in the SRAM on the device.
 *      The whole SRAM portion corresponding to the .data section is
 *      initialized to their respective byte values by autogenerated
 *      code executed before main() is run.
 *
 *   c) Initialized constants in the .text section.  Those are placed
 *      into the program flash on the device, and due to the AVR's
 *      Harvard architecture, need special instructions to
 *      read. Unused so far.
 *
 *   d) Register variables.  We only use them in the uninitialized
 *      variety so far for the assembly language version
 *      ISR(ADC_vect), if you choose to compile and link that.
 *
 *   e) EEPROM variables.  We are not using those anywhere yet.
 *
 * All in all, this means that for normal memory variables,
 * initialized or uninitialized, we do not need to initialize anything
 * at the start of main().

 *
 * We do synchronized reading of the multi-byte variable timer_count
 * here (which is being written to by the ISR(TIMER1_COMPA_vect) while
 * send_histogram() is being executed for 'I' histograms). For all other
 * types of histograms, this busy sync loop will still work, but is not
 * required as all interrupts will be disabled.
 *
 * Reading both #timer_count and #last_timer_count consists basically of
 * the following four steps:
 *
 *   a) read lo8(#timer_count)
 *
 *   b) read hi8(#timer_count)
 *
 *   c) read lo8(#last_timer_count)
 *
 *   d) read hi8(#last_timer_count)
 *
 * Now we have a finite set of sequences in which those instructions
 * and ISR(TIMER1_COMPA_vect) can be executed in relation to each
 * other (keep in mind that the #timer_count is counted backwards):
 *
 *  1. ISR before a): No problem whatsoever.  #last_timer_count will
 *     be 1 more than #timer_count.  The while loop will finish.
 *
 *  2. ISR between a) and b): #timer_count will differ from
 *     #last_timer_count by two, or a lot more in the case of a 8bit
 *     overflow happening.  The while loop will continue.
 *
 *  3. ISR between b) and c): #timer_count will be the same as
 *     #last_timer_count.  The while loop will continue.
 *
 *  4. ISR between c) and d): #timer_count will be the same as
 *     #last_timer_count (just like case 3), or a lot more in the case
 *     of a 8bit overflow happening.  The while loop will continue.
 *
 *  5. ISR after d): No problem whatsoever.  #last_timer_count will be
 *     1 more than #timer_count.  The while loop will finish.
 *
 * As the ISR runs only every second, and we can reasonably presume
 * that the while loop can repeats a number of times during that
 * second, this will terminate quite quickly with a useful result.
 *
 * The result may be off by one for the 'I' histograms but not by
 * more, and for 'I' results we can tolerate that kind of inaccuracy.
 *
 * Durations for finished measurements will always be accurate, as
 * that will trigger case 1.
