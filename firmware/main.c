 *
 * There can be a number of kinds of variables.
 *
 *   a) Uninitialized non-register variables.  Those are placed in the
 *      .bss section in the ELF file, and in the SRAM on the device.
 *      The whole SRAM portion corresponding to the .bss section is
 *      initialized to zero bytes in the startup code, so we do not
 *      need to initialized those variables anywhere.
 *
 *   b) Initialized non-register variables.  Those are placed in the
 *      .data section in the ELF file, and in the SRAM on the device.
 *      The whole SRAM portion corresponding to the .data section is
 *      initialized to their respective byte values by autogenerated
 *      code executed before main() is run.
 *
 *   c) Initialized constants in the .text section.  Those are placed
 *      into the program flash on the device, and due to the AVR's
 *      Harvard architecture, need special instructions to
 *      read. Unused so far.
 *
 *   d) Register variables.  We only use them in the uninitialized
 *      variety so far for the assembly language version
 *      ISR(ADC_vect), if you choose to compile and link that.
 *
 *   e) EEPROM variables.  We are not using those anywhere yet.
 *
 * All in all, this means that for normal memory variables,
 * initialized or uninitialized, we do not need to initialize anything
 * at the start of main().
 *
 * Also note that the ATmega644 has 4K of SRAM. With an ADC resolution
 * of 10 bit, we need to store 2^10 = 1024 = 1K values in our
 * histogram table. This results in the following memory sizes for the
 * histogram table:
 *
 *    uint16_t: 2K
 *    uint24_t: 3K
 *    uint32_t: 4K
 *
 * We could fit the global variables into otherwise unused registers
 * to free some more SRAM, but we cannot move the stack into register
 * space. This means we cannot use uint32_t counters in the table -
 * the absolute maximum sized integer we can use is our self-defined
 * "uint24_t" type.

/** AVR firmware's main "loop" function
 *
 * Note that we create a "loop" by having the watchdog timer reset the
 * AVR device when one loop iteration is finished. This will cause the
 * system to start again with the hardware and software in the defined
 * default state.
 *
 * This function implements the finite state machine (FSM) as
 * described in \ref embedded_fsm.  The "ST_foo" and "ST_FOO"
 * definitions from #firmware_state_t refer to the states from that FSM
 * definition.
 *
 * Note that the ST_MEASURING state had to be split into two:
 * ST_MEASURING which prints its name upon entering and immediately
 * continues with ST_MEASURING_nomsg, and ST_MEASURING_nomsg which
 * does not print its name upon entering and is thus feasible for a
 * busy polling loop.
 *
 * avr-gcc knows that int main(void) ending with an endless loop and
 * not returning is normal, so we can avoid the
 *
 *    int main(void) __attribute__((noreturn));
 *
 * declaration and compile without warnings (or an unused return instruction
 * at the end of main).
