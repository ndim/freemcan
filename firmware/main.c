 * There can be a number of kinds of variables.
 *
 *   a) Uninitialized non-register variables.  Those are placed in the
 *      .bss section in the ELF file, and in the SRAM on the device.
 *      The whole SRAM portion corresponding to the .bss section is
 *      initialized to zero bytes in the startup code, so we do not
 *      need to initialized those variables anywhere.
 *
 *   b) Initialized non-register variables.  Those are placed in the
 *      .data section in the ELF file, and in the SRAM on the device.
 *      The whole SRAM portion corresponding to the .data section is
 *      initialized to their respective byte values by autogenerated
 *      code executed before main() is run.
 *
 *   c) Initialized constants in the .text section.  Those are placed
 *      into the program flash on the device, and due to the AVR's
 *      Harvard architecture, need special instructions to
 *      read. Unused so far.
 *
 *   d) Register variables.  We only use them in the uninitialized
 *      variety so far for the assembly language version
 *      ISR(ADC_vect), if you choose to compile and link that.
 *
 *   e) EEPROM variables.  We are not using those anywhere yet.
 *
 * All in all, this means that for normal memory variables,
 * initialized or uninitialized, we do not need to initialize anything
 * at the start of main().
