 * \param receive_time Timestamp at which the packet was received.
 * \param element_size Size of each element in bytes (1,2,3,4).
 * \param element_count The number of elements received from device.
 * \param duration The duration of the measurement which produced
 *                 the data in elements.
 * \param total_duration The total duration of the running measurement
 *                       until it will be completed.
 * \param elements Pointer to the array of data as received from the
 *                 device.  A NULL pointer is interpreted like an
 *                 array consisting entirely of zeros.
 *
 * Note that the determination of max_value disregards the last value
 * in the array due to that being the value where ADC clamping is
 * counted.
