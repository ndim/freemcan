 *
 * \section packet_emb_to_host From firmware to hostware: Histogram packet
 *
 * The size of the histogram data is determined from the total packet
 * data size (i.e. the frame's payload size) by subtracting the size
 * of the #packet_histogram_header_t that is sent in front of
 * histogram data.
