/** UART baud rate
 *
 * This value is must be agreed upon by both hostware and firmware.
 *
 * Host side constraints for this value: The well-known set of
 * baudrates the UART supports.
 *
 * Device side constraints for this value: Needs "UL" suffix to make
 * sure the divisions work out correctly for the 16bit integers on the
 * AVR chips. Resulting real baud rate needs to be close enough to the
 * theoretical value so that the host's UART can properly reconstruct
 * the clock signal.
 *
 * \todo Maybe it would be possible for the AVR to store the baud rate
 *       in the EEPROM, and there could be a command to adapt the
 *       firmware's baud rate without needing to recompile and
 *       re-program the firmware?
